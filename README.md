# Hex-Game
The game of Hex with an AI opponent using the Monte Carlo Method (in C++)
Download and run the Hex.cc file (also a "Hex" executable file, if you don't want to compile)
The game, when run with a "human" player, requires a 2-integer input specifying the location of the hexagon
Any node has the following nodes as adjacent (if present): North, South, North-East, North-West, South-East, South-West.
Note: Nodes to the East and West of a node are NOT adjacent to that node.

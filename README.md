# Hex-Game
The game of Hex with an AI opponent using the Monte Carlo Method (in C++):  

* Download and run the "Hex" executable file, or download all the C++ source files and compile "Hex.cc".  

* The game, when run with a "human" player, requires 2 space-seperated integer as input specifying the location of the hexagon.  

* Hex Rules: https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~csangwin/hex/index.html.  

* On the terminal/cmd: Any hexagon (hexagons are representated as bracketed co-ordinates) has the following hexagons as adjacent (if present): North, South, North-East, North-West, South-East, South-West. *Note: Hexagons to the East and West of a hexagon are NOT adjacent to that hexagon.
* *Note*: Downloading the executable file might fail due to virus detection. This is a false positive. Please allow the file to download through Windows Security/Windows Defender.
